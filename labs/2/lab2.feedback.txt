Joseph, 

About your programs...

Functionality

- Could not test functionality because programs cannot be compiled. 100 errors
  while compiling!!!  -3pts

Please make sure you read the problems well; follow instructions.


Style Check

- Horrible style. My eyes have tears after reading your code. 

- You used tabs, which is forbidden. -1pt

- There is incorrect indentation. -1pt

Please make sure you follow the style guidelines and that your programs can be
compiled using javac. Penalties will be higher as the semester moves forward.



Peace,

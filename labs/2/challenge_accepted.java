Make a program that calculates the percentage total grade of a student in this class
and then outputs the corresponding letter grade. The program will ask for a percentage (0 â€“ 100%)
corresponding to each of the four rubrics in this course and will calculate the total final grade for the
student, then, based on the grading policy for this class (here http://www.reev.us/cmpt220s17t/)
you will output the corresponding letter grade.
